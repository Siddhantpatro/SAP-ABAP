foreign keys----------------------------------
    used to establish relationships between various tables in ABAP dictionary
    value checks can be created for input fields with help of foreign keys
    it links 2 tables by assigning the foreign key fields of one table to the primary key of another table

table validation-------------------------------
    it is a concept through which we can restrict invalid entries in a table
    possible methods/concepts for table validation:
        field level validation      :       we can validate entries at field level with help of check table concept
        domain level validation     :       we can restrict entries at domain level with help of fixed values of domain and value table of domain

check table-------------------------------------
    check table                 :   table which stores master data
    foreign key table           :   table which is linked with check table for validating its own data
    foreign key relationship    :   relation between 2/more tables for validating data

creating foreign key relation-------------------
    steps: (example)
        create table "zcustomers" with fields:
            customernumber      key     init.       num   
            customername                            name
        create records of zcustomers
        create table "zcustomers_bank" with fields:
            cno                 key     init.       num
            bankid                                  id
            bankname                                name
        open table zcustomers_bank
        select cno field
        click on foreign keys button/icon
        provide check table name = zcustomers
        click on generate proposal button
        click on copy button
        save & activate
