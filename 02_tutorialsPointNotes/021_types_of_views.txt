types of views----------------------------------------------
    database view
    projection view
    help view
    maintenance view

database view-----------------------------------------------
    a view created on 2/more tables by clubbing the fields using inner join is called database join
    here, we can only read data
    no maintenance operation can be done
    it can include an entire table

    example: develop a db view on MARA, MAKT tables to display:
        MATNR           MARA
        MTART           MARA
        MBRSH           MARA
        MEINS           MARA
        SPRAS           MAKT
        MAKTX           MAKT

    steps:
        go to se11
        select view and give name "zdbview1"
        click on create button
        select database view and click copy button
        provide short description
        go to tables/joins conditions
        provide table names along with join condition:
            Tables                      Join conditions
            MARA                        Tables          field name      =   table       field name
            MAKT                        MARA            MANDT           =   MAKT        MANDT
                                        MARA            MATNR           =   MAKT        MATNR
        click on view fields tab
        click on table fields button
        double cick on MARA, select the fields:
            MATNR
            MTART
            MBRSH
            MEINS
        click on copy button
        double click on MAKT, select the fields:
            SPRAS
            MAKTX
        click on copy button
        go to selection condition tab, provide the condition:
            table       field name          operator        comparison value        and/or
            MAKT        SPRAS               eq              'E'                     or
            MAKT        MAKTX               eq              'Sony Sunny'
        save, check and activate
        click on contents button (ctrl + shift + f10)
        click on execute button (f8)

projection view----------------------------------------------------
    it is created on a single table
    advantage: we can project only required/limited fields by filtering the unwanted fields
    read and maintenance of data is allowed
    from database point of view, it improves the system performance as we minimize the fields

    example: develop a projection view on MARA table to display only:
        MATNR
        MTART
        MBRSH
        MEINS
    
    steps:
        go to se11
        select view and give name "zpview1"
        click on create
        select projection view
        click on copy button
        provide short description
        give table name and click on table fields button
        select fields:
            MATNR
            MTART
            MBRSH
            MEINS
        click on maintenance status tab
        select "read and change" radio button
        save, check and activate
        click on contents icon
        click on execute icon

help view----------------------------------------------------------------
    a view created on 2/more tables for sreach-helps is called help view
    it uses outer join concept
    here data can only be read, not maintained
    these views cannot be executed, because these are designed only for search-helps

    creating help view--------------------------------------------------
        steps:
            go to se11
            select view and give name "zhview1"
            click on create
            select help view and click on copy button
            provide short description
            give table name as MARA and press enter
            click on relationship button and select and click on copy button
            join condition will be automatically proposed by system
            go to view fields tab
            click on "table fields" button, select MARA
            click on choose button
            select the fields
            click on copy button
            select MAKT table and select required fields
            go to selection conditions tab
            give condition
            save, check and activate

maintenance view---------------------------------------------------------------
    it is created on 2/more tables using inner join
    here, we can read and maintain data
    it can create data inconsistency problems
    it should not be created on standard tables. it should be created only on custom tables

    creating maintenance view--------------------------------------------------
        steps:
            go to se11
            select view and give name "zmview1"
            click on create button
            select maintenance view and click on copy button
            provide short description
            give table name as MARA and press enter
            click on relationship button and click on copy button
            join condition will be automatically proposed by system
            click on table fields button and select MARA
            click on choose button
            select fields and click on copy
            select MAKT and select required fields
            go to selection conditions tab and give the condition
                    table   field name      operator    comparison value    and/or
                    MARA    MTART           eq          'FERT'              AND
                    MAKT    SPRAS           eq          'E'
            go to maint.ststus tab
            select access = read, change, delete and insert
            click on save, check and activate
            click on utilities > table maintenance generator
            provide details as:
                authorization group =   &NC&
                function group      =   ztag1_group
                maintenance types   =   one step
                overview screen     =   1
            click on create button
            click on save
            go to sm30
