value table-----------------------------------------
    table name defined at domain level so that all table fields will be reffering to the domain will be checked or validated with a single table called as value table
    main advantage : automate the system for foreign key relation, i.e., system will automatically display check table name to generate foreign key proposal
    if foreign key for a field is defined that points to this domain, the value of the domain is proposed as check table for foreign key

creating value table--------------------------------
    steps:
        create table zzcustomer with fields:
            cno         zcno
            cname       zcname
        create some records
        define check table name at domain level:    (this check table is called value table)
            goto domain zcno
            click on value range tab
            provide value table as zzcustomer
            save and activate, domain and table
        create another table by name zzcustomer_bank with fields:
            cno
            bankid
            bankname
        maintain foreign key relationship:
            open zzcustomer_bank table
            select cno field and click on foreign key button
            a pop-up will appear with value table to be proposed for check table
            choose:
                yes     foreign key relation will be automatically displayed
                no      it will not be displayed

check table VS value table-----------------------------
    check table                                             value table
    - defined at field level                                - defined at domain level
    - FK relation is not automatic, we must enter           - FK relation is automatic, once we maintain value table
      check table name                                        FK relation is automatically generated
