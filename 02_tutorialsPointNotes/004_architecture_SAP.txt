R/2 architecture---------------------------------------------------
    2 tier architecture
        - Server Layer : responds to clients
        - Client Layer : requests the servers
    disadvantages
        as clients increases, load on db server increases, response is delayed
        as response is delayed, output is slow on client systems

R/3 architecture---------------------------------------------------
    3 tier architecture
        - db server Layer               : only stores data
        - application server Layer      : only executes applications/programs
        - presentation server Layer     : just presenting the output and taking input
