database table---------------------------------------------------
    it is an object that stores data in form of rows and columns
    each row is called record, each column is called field
    to define a table, first fields are to be defined
    to define a field, data element and domain are to be specified

    defining field:
        datatype    :   domain
        length      :   domain
        desciption  :   data element

        field = data element + domain
    
    domain:
        object which specifies technical information such as data type and length for a field
        also specifies sign, lower case, conversion routine, fixed values and value table
    
    data element:
        object which specifies semantic information such as short desciption, field labels (short, medium, long and heading) for a field
    
    advantages:
        reusability:    same data element and domain can be reused by multiple table fields
        these are also used in creating foreign key relationship, search help, ale-idoc's

    key field:
        a field which is used to identify the record uniquely
        every table SHOULD contain atleast 1 key field
